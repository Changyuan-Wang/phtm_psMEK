# phtm_psMEK

This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Changyuan-Wang/phtm_psMEK/blob/main/phtm_psMEK.ipynb) consists of three parts:

1. Reading and normalizing the experimental data.

2. Using optimization to fit the model to the experimental data (both raw and bootstrapped). This step yields the model parameters and the 95% confidence intervals for all predictions.

3. Generating the results and figures presented in the paper.
